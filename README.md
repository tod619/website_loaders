## Description
An example for 3 different website loading animations.  The first one is a group of dots that pulse and grow at different intervals.  The next loader is five lines that get taller and smaller at different times.  The final loader is a row of circles each with their own shadow effect that grows and shrinks in time.  The animation effects are created using keyframes and the timing effects are created by using different delay timings on each elements.

## Demo
